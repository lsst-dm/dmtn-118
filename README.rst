Review of Timeseries Features
#############################

DMTN-118
========

The DPDD allocates space for pre-computed timeseries features, and a sample set is baselined in LDM-151. However, other features have been developed. This technote reviews the relevant literature, grouping related features where possible, and discusses potential concerns.

Updating acronyms
-----------------

A table of the technote's acronyms and their definitions are maintained in the `acronyms.tex` file, which is committed as part of this repository.
To update the acronyms table in ``acronyms.tex``::

    make acronyms.tex

*Note: this command requires that this repository was cloned as a submodule.*

The acronyms discovery code scans the LaTeX source for probable acronyms.
You can ensure that certain strings aren't treated as acronyms by adding them to the `skipacronyms.txt <./skipacronyms.txt>`_ file.

The lsst-texmf_ repository centrally maintains definitions for LSST acronyms.
You can also add new acronym definitions, or override the definitions of acronyms, by editing the `myacronyms.txt <./myacronyms.txt>`_ file.

Updating lsst-texmf
-------------------

`lsst-texmf`_ includes BibTeX files, the ``lsstdoc`` class file, and acronym definitions, among other essential tooling for LSST's LaTeX documentation projects.
To update to a newer version of `lsst-texmf`_, you can update the submodule in this repository::

   git submodule update --init --recursive

Commit, then push, the updated submodule.
